This app was developed throughout 2022 and beginning of 2023 for the lab of Prof. Marc Timmers in Freiburg, Germany.

It features selection of proteinGroup files created through Maxquant software (3x2 pulldown/control),
and allows for analyses of singular and multiple datasets. Creates UMAP and heatmaps of multiple experiments, 
and volcano plots with highlighted proteins/genes (selection through an additional excel file). 

All data used is proprietary to Prof. Marc Timmers and DKFZ funding, as such there is no example data shown here.
See the word document (was written for request of further data analysis) for more information about the method.
See the tutorial document for a rundown on how to use the app.
Contact me (Jellebonthuis@hotmail.com) for a private rundown/example of how the app works.
