This repository serves as a curated showcase of my coding expertise, initially created for personal use rather than online sharing. 
However, in the interest of highlighting my coding proficiency for a Ph.D. application (and Junior lecturer in data analytics), I have chosen to include my ongoing/unfinished projects (alongside a completed RShiny application).
Additionally, this repository houses various resources, such as student-friendly analyses, utilities tailored for wet-lab environments, and a collection of small scripts designed for diverse applications.
