This is a repository with examples of coding experience, I never intended to share these online, 
however for the sake of showing at least in some ways that I have coding experience, 
I have included my unfinished projects here (as well as the finished RShiny app).
Other files include analyeses written for students, tools for wet-lab environments and some random small scripts.
